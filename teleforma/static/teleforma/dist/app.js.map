\"stand-alone\" units, but are different in some languages.\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular:\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n *\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table (e.g. `EEEEEEEEEEE`)\n *    the output will be the same as default pattern for this unit, usually\n *    the longest one (in case of ISO weekdays, `EEEE`). Default patterns for units\n *    are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMM') //=> 'Nov'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMM') //=> 'N'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n * 3. Some patterns could be unlimited length (such as `yyyyyyyy`).\n *    The output will be padded with zeros to match the length of the pattern.\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'yyyyyyyy') //=> '00002017'`\n *\n * 4. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n *\n * 5. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n *\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n *    |------|-----|-----|\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n *\n *    Also `yy` always returns the last two digits of a year,\n *    while `uu` pads single digit years to 2 characters and returns other years unchanged:\n *\n *    | Year | `yy` | `uu` |\n *    |------|------|------|\n *    | 1    |   01 |   01 |\n *    | 14   |   14 |   14 |\n *    | 376  |   76 |  376 |\n *    | 1453 |   53 | 1453 |\n *\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [getISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getISOWeekYear}\n *    and [getWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeekYear}).\n *\n * 6. Specific non-location timezones are currently unavailable in `date-fns`,\n *    so right now these tokens fall back to GMT timezones.\n *\n * 7. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n *    - `t`: seconds timestamp\n *    - `T`: milliseconds timestamp\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n *    - `P`: long localized date\n *    - `p`: long localized time\n *\n * 8. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * 9. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are often confused with days of the month.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n *\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n *\n * - The second argument is now required for the sake of explicitness.\n *\n *   ```javascript\n *   // Before v2.0.0\n *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1))\n *\n *   // v2.0.0 onward\n *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1), \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSxxx\")\n *   ```\n *\n * - New format string API for `format` function\n *   which is based on [Unicode Technical Standard #35](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).\n *   See [this post](https://blog.date-fns.org/post/unicode-tokens-in-date-fns-v2-sreatyki91jg) for more details.\n *\n * - Characters are now escaped using single quote symbols (`'`) instead of square brackets.\n *\n * @param {Date|Number} date - the original date\n * @param {String} format - the string of tokens\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object.

Mapping from frequency to\n barks is given by freq2bark()\n\n scalefactor bands: The spectrum (frequencies) are broken into\n SBMAX \"scalefactor bands\".  Thes bands\n are determined by the MPEG ISO spec.  In\n the noise shaping/quantization code, we allocate\n bits among the partition bands to achieve the\n best possible quality\n\n partition bands:   The spectrum is also broken into about\n 64 \"partition bands\".  Each partition\n band is about .34 barks wide.  There are about 2-5\n partition bands for each scalefactor band.\n\n LAME computes all psycho acoustic information for each partition\n band.  Then at the end of the computations, this information\n is mapped to scalefactor bands.  The energy in each scalefactor\n band is taken as the sum of the energy in all partition bands\n which overlap the scalefactor band.  The maskings can be computed\n in the same way (and thus represent the average masking in that band)\n or by taking the minmum value multiplied by the number of\n partition bands used (which represents a minimum masking in that band).\n */\n/*\n The general outline is as follows:\n\n 1. compute the energy in each partition band\n 2. compute the tonality in each partition band\n 3. compute the strength of each partion band \"masker\"\n 4. compute the masking (via the spreading function applied to each masker)\n 5. Modifications for mid/side masking.\n\n Each partition band is considiered a \"masker\".  The strength\n of the i'th masker in band j is given by:\n\n s3(bark(i)-bark(j))*strength(i)\n\n The strength of the masker is a function of the energy and tonality.\n The more tonal, the less masking.  LAME uses a simple linear formula\n (controlled by NMT and TMN) which says the strength is given by the\n energy divided by a linear function of the tonality.\n */\n/*\n s3() is the \"spreading function\".  It is given by a formula\n determined via listening tests.\n\n The total masking in the j'th partition band is the sum over\n all maskings i.  It is thus given by the convolution of\n the strength with s3(), the \"spreading function.\"\n\n masking(j) = sum_over_i  s3(i-j)*strength(i)  = s3 o strength\n\n where \"o\" = convolution operator.  s3 is given by a formula determined\n via listening tests.  It is normalized so that s3 o 1 = 1.\n\n Note: instead of a simple convolution, LAME also has the\n option of using \"additive masking\"\n\n The most critical part is step 2, computing the tonality of each\n partition band.  LAME has two tonality estimators.  The first\n is based on the ISO spec, and measures how predictiable the\n signal is over time.  The more predictable, the more tonal.\n The second measure is based on looking at the spectrum of\n a single granule.  The more peaky the spectrum, the more\n tonal.  By most indications, the latter approach is better.\n\n Finally, in step 5, the maskings for the mid and side\n channel are possibly increased.
